Repository for Project 2 - Team Broly 

#Project Overview
While working for the Allana & Erica Inc, our team is tasked with developing a predictive model to determine the likelihood of a customer making a purchase based on historical behavior and other demographic data. We obtained a dataset of over 1500 customers from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rabieelkharoua/predict-customer-purchase-behavior-dataset), which showed the age, gender, annual income, number of purchases, project category, time on website, loyalty program of customers and discounts available to customers A supervised ML model was used to solve, analyze and visualize the historical behavior to determine future sales. 

#Installation Instructions
In order to analyze our data we follow different statistical analysis techniques including Scikit-learn to discover patterns and findings. Then, we illustrate our observations with visuals to help communicate our process and conclusion.

As our data was being prepared, we focused on model implementation and optimization where we focused on three model selections
1. Logistic Regression
2. Decision Trees
3. Random Forest 

In order to evaluate the performance of the selected model we used the following metrics:  
1. Accuracy 
2. Precision 
3. Recall 
4. FI Score 
5. ROC AUC Score 

#Results and Summary 
After analyzing the data we have made the following conclusions on future sales and costumers 
1. The Random Forest provided the best output for the analysis 
2. Person are more likely to buy if they have customer loyalty and discounts
